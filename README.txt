Implementation of Common industrial Protocol (CIP) via EtherNet [EtherNet/IP (CIP)]

EtherNet_IP_PCCC (./EtherNET_IP)
================================

Use these set of VIs to communicate with MicroLogix Series PLCs Via EtherNet.

These VIs use simple TCP/IP Communication.

Communication : Ethernet, TCP/IP
Protocol :      EtherNet/IP
Service :       CIP (For Connection Management), CIP Service for PCCC
Command :       PCCC

Tested with :   MicroLogix 1100, MicroLogix 1500,1200(with NET-ENI)

No OPC Server Required
No Automation Server Required
No NI-DSC Module Required.

Note: These VIs access N7 Integer File. To access other Files in the PLCs, just replace the "Fileno" Constant(0x07) with a Control and make it as a parameter to the SubVI.


EtherNet_IP_CIP (./EtherNET_IP_CIP)
===================================

Use these set of VIs to communicate with CompactLogix, Control Logix Series PLCs, Any Device that supports CIP(EtherNet/IP)

These VIs uses simple TCP/IP Communication.

Communication : Ethernet, TCP/IP
Protocol :      EtherNet/IP
Service :       CIP (For Connection Management, Read, Write)
Command :       CIP Commands

Tested with :   Compact Logix Series PLCs

No OPC Server Required
No Automation Server Required
No NI-DSC Module Required.
